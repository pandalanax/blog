# Sponsoring
![Mastodon Screenshot of LVFS announcing sponsorship from Framework](/assets/december_mastodon.png)
 [Stuff](https://mastodon.social/@hughsie/115628170779065489) like this is so cool. 
I feel like with the ongoing Enshittification of Microsoft and Apple also having [a blast at collecting data](https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/), stuff like this creates hope.
The linux desktop environment is blooming. Valve doing distributions not just for gaming, framework sponsoring Hyprland, CachyOS and LVFS, joining Linux Foundation. There are corporations sponsoring projects that rely on community.  
However, I'd also like to mention a side note on Hyprland: [https://drewdevault.com/2023/09/17/Hyprland-toxicity.html](https://drewdevault.com/2023/09/17/Hyprland-toxicity.html)

# Got a Brompton
In support of our car free lifestyle, i bought a Brompton C line.
Really suprised by the amount of flex the frame provides, a not-so-long time but enough time to be afraid of 35mm tires, i was a roadie on 28-33mm tires. The brompton though feels very comfortable even with Schwalbe Marathon which are known to be a bit harsh.
Quickly swapped all three contact points: saddle, grips, pedals and it is just as comfy as my touring bike (50mm tires).

# Creating magic 
Somewhere on the internet i read about someone complaining or rather wondering why christmas used to feel different than it is now and i came across a very nice answer:
In the past people used to create all the magic for you. You were consuming their work to make christmas a special occasion. Now it’s up to you to create this magic for other people. If you look into the windows that is exactly what people do. You can see lit stars and fairy lights.
