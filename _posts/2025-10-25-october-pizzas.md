# Making Pizza
We made a pizza party with some friends and their Ferrari pizza oven. i don't know if the brand is actually related to the car company but the oven is in red color.
I started making pizza dough at home and while researching why my dough is always different i came across this cultural difference between indian and western bread recipes.
While in the western world it is common to have the water relative to the dough ( e.g. 70% hydration), a lot of indian recipes have a fixed amount of water and add flour to it until the dough becomes manageable.
That method teached me a lot more about how the specific flour that i am using reacts to hydration and kneading. Instead of having everything fixed from the start it is much easier to understand what the dough actually needs in terms of more kneading, rest time or water. i encourage you to try it that way.
I liked the sweet one with apples, sugar and cinnamon the most.

# Bike as a car
We do not own a car and now realised that we need to see our bikes as our main way of transportation. people pay so much money for car maintenance and fuel, it easily justifies buying a new bike bag or to buy a new set of cork grips.

# Celery
Celery is the lemon of autumn. We've been eating a lot of celery lately and it makes those comfort foods a bit richer and fresher in taste. I am talking about the green type of celery and not the celery root! important distinction!

# Music
The people at [Numero Group](https://numerogroup.com/blogs/stream){:target="_blank"} are incredibly talented at making playlists that capture emotions. Ever wondered what a playlist would sound like that captured that feeling when you are [ lost at sea ](https://spotify.link/huVCn6XKFXb){:target="_blank"}?

# Smartwatches
I've had my apple watch for half a year now and i am generally happy with it. It is not what i'd hope it would be (mainly mp3 player) but it surprised me in other aspects such as hiking with Workoutdoors which is just fantastic, setting reminders quickly and having a easy way of 2FA for everything. 
However it do sometimes feels like a chore when the watch is bugging, vibrating to remind you to track your outdoor walk (to the supermarket) or reminding you to stand up at 4 o'clock in the morning because you forgot to put on sleep mode. All of that should be solved by software and kept out of the users need to manage it. But it is not. Thats why i've gone analog for now. I need a watch, sometimes i need a smartwatch. Feels nice to have the decision.
