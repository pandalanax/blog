# Working on a Brompton
We successfully fitted a rack (more involved than one would think) on a Brompton and while working on it we both thought that the engineering behind everything is just wonderful. I would say i am a fairly experienced (notice the lack of positive adverbs) mechanic when it comes to bikes but i had never worked on a brompton until now.
You want to fit a rack and along the process you encounter so many "woooah thats genius" moments. It was great fun!

Now we needed the rack for our adventure (see photos). The route, however, was too much for a Brompton.

# Trying Emacs
I have a [perfect neovim setup](https://github.com/pandalanax/panda-nix-vim) but one thing that bothered me was that a buffer has no special context.
I don’t do a lot of programming; it’s more sysadmin/devops-type work. Lots of remote servers where i have to check things.
Then i discovered Emacs TRAMP, which you can use to access remote files over ssh. But the best part is that other plugins respect TRAMPs context. If I am in a remote buffer and open a terminal that session is on the remote in the directory i was working in.
Same with proced (top in emacs), daemons, journalctl and other tools. 


# Down Dog
Down Dog is a yoga app that lets you customise every practice. You can activate different boosts like "Hamstring Stretches" or "Upper Back Strength", set different voices, length, tips and so on. It then creates a practice for that day. And it works!  Had to give them a shout-out.

# Comics
I've been enjoying the [Bone comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_(comics)) lately.
